# comments
This script reads the logfiles and generates the end of experiment email file. The script claims to read correctly the module names and data recorded, automatically list windstow times and scans, and extract comments made by the observer.

To run the script:
python comments.py

The script will then ask for the details of the experiment, read the logfile and generate a file which can be used to email.

The generated email will contain:
The modules used and the data recorded
Windstow times and scans
comments made by the observer
